# SKSE - writing to log files

A simple SKSE plugin for Skyrim using:

- C++
- CMake
- [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG)
  - _automatically downloaded using vcpkg integration of CMake_

> Because this uses CommonLibSSE NG, it supports Skyrim SSE, AE, GOG, and VR!

### What does it do?

It writes to a log file.

Read [`plugin.cpp`](plugin.cpp) for a bunch of details on what it's doing!

I *highly recommend* you create a log file for your mod.

It's useful for:
- your own debugging, while developing the mod
- debugging issues from your users (**ask your users to provide .log files in their bug reports on Nexus/GitHub!**)

### Requires:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (_the free Community edition is fine!_)
- [`vcpkg`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - 1. Clone the repository using git OR [download it as a .zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
  - 2. Go into the `vcpkg` folder and double-click on `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`
  - 3. Edit your system or user Environment Variables and add a new one:
    - Name: `VCPKG_ROOT`  
      Value: `C:\path\to\wherever\your\vcpkg\folder\is`

Once you have Visual Studio 2022 installed, you can open this folder in basically any C++ editor, e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- > _for VS Code, if you are not automatically prompted to install the [C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extensions, please install those and then close VS Code and then open this project as a folder in VS Code_

You may need to click `OK` on a few windows, but the project should automatically run CMake!

It will _automatically_ download [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) and everything you need to get started making your new plugin!

### Setup:

After downloading, please:

- Go into `LICENSE` and change the year and change `<YOUR NAME HERE>` to your name.
- Go into `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and change `<YOUR CONTACT INFO HERE>` to your contact information.

It's good to have a `Code of Conduct` and GitHub will show your project's `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the project sidebar.
